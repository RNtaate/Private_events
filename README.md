# Private Events

## Project Description

This project involves building a lighter version of [eventbrites](https://www.eventbrite.com/) to demonstrate the concept of Associations in Ruby on Rails.

In the project, a user can sign up and sign in, create events and invite other users to those particular events.

An Unregistered User **can neither** create events **nor** view details of a particular event, but can view a list of created events by other users.
